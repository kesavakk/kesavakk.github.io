    <h1>Final Project</h1>

    <h2>Role: Designer</h2>

      The color contrst ration is 1.83:1 below the navigation bar where the user can view his location on the website which is the less than 4.5:1, So it recommended to user a darker color for the text while keeping the same background color.
      <br>
      <br>
      The twitter icon and the back to top icon at the bottom of the page belong to same hue (grey) but different value. It is recommended that these icons should be of a different hue than grey to create more contrast.
      <br>
      <br>

      The search icon on top of the page does not show the fillable search field as default so it will be diffucult for user with visual problems to recongnize the fillable search field until clicked on the icon. So I would recommend to add a fillble search field with the word 'search' as a placeholder text.
      <br>
      <br>
      While tabbing beyond the header the icon tiles are not getting focussed, so I would recommend to make the tiles to show the focus states of the tiles when tabbing on the web page.
      <br>
      <br>
      All the images in the tiles don't have any alt text on checking on the wave validator. So the browser wont be able to read aloud the when landing on the image. So I recommend to add good alt text where ever its missing.
