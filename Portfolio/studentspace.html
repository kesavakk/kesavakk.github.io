          <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
          <p>I explored through the existing alternative solutions that are either available or being used by the students to find required information and to interact with each other. With parameters such as features, pros, and cons solution are later analysed by comparing with each other. The competitive analysis helped me to find the shortcomings of the available solutions.

          <h3>User Interviews and Surveys</h3>
          <p>To understand the user need I conducted six user interviews of both graduate and undergraduate students in the University of Michigan School of Information. Most of the incoming students shared that they had a bad experience while choosing the courses as they don't know much information about the schools and its professors. All the decisions made by them we either random or through the limited information available on the school's website. Current students expressed that, they are not able to keep an update on the current information trends happening around.
          <br>
          <br>

          From the user surveys another problem got uncovered, which was that the students were not able to interact with each other, as they feel that to advance in the information field interaction with multiple students will open new ideas that lead to better innovations. Click here to find the survey used to gather the user needs.
